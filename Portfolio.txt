Key Concepts Covered:

HTML Structure: Semantic HTML5 elements (<header>, <nav>, <main>, <section>, <footer>, etc.) for better organization and SEO.

CSS Styling:
Basic Resets: * { margin: 0; padding: 0; box-sizing: border-box; } for consistent rendering across browsers.
CSS Variables (:root): For easy theme customization and maintainability.
Typography and Colors: Setting font families, sizes, and a color palette.
Layouts: Flexbox for navigation and about section, CSS Grid for project gallery.
Hover Effects: Smooth transitions on buttons and project cards (transition, transform).
Responsive Design (@media queries): Adapting the layout for mobile, tablet, and desktop screens, including a responsive navigation menu (burger icon).

JavaScript Interactivity:
DOM Manipulation: Selecting and modifying HTML elements.
Smooth Scrolling: Using scroll-behavior: smooth in CSS and JavaScript for precise scrolling to sections, accounting for a sticky header.
Active Navigation Link: Dynamically highlighting the current section in the navigation bar based on scroll position.
Mobile Navigation Toggle: Implementing a burger menu to show/hide navigation on smaller screens.

Form Validation:
Client-side validation to ensure required fields are filled and email format is correct.
Displaying error messages for each field.
Preventing form submission if validation fails.
Simulating a success message upon valid submission (for a real project, this would involve a backend).
Resume Download: A direct link to a PDF version of your resume, opening in a new tab.
Accessibility (Basic): Use of semantic HTML and clear labels for form fields.

The error I got in this code was I was unable to open the resume that means The Resume button was not operable.

Hence, the solution was to make changes in .js file:

-- Key changes:

Inside the navLinks.forEach click handler, I added an if condition:

JavaScript

if (targetHref && targetHref.startsWith('#')) {
    e.preventDefault(); // Only prevent default for internal links
    // ... smooth scrolling logic ...
}
This ensures that e.preventDefault() (which stops the browser from doing its default action, like opening the PDF) is only called for links that are meant for smooth scrolling. For the resume link, the browser's default behavior (target="_blank") will now be allowed to execute, opening the PDF in a new tab.

I also added const header = document.querySelector('header'); outside the scroll and click listeners to avoid repeatedly selecting the header element.

Save this updated script.js file and refresh your browser. Your resume button should now open the PDF in a new tab, and the smooth scrolling for internal links should continue to work.
